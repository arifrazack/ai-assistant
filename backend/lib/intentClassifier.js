AVAILABLE TOOLS:
${TOOL_REGISTRY.map(tool => 
    `- ${tool.name}: ${tool.description}`
  ).join('\n')}

YOUR TASK:
Analyze the user's message and determine:
1. What they want to achieve
2. Whether it needs tools or just conversation
3. If tools are needed, which ones and in what execution pattern

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ANTI-TYPING RULE:
If the user's message contains ANY of these keywords: "solve", "answer", "help with", "work through" combined with "questions" or "problems":
‚Üí ALWAYS use ["call_llm"] for analysis and problem-solving
‚Üí NEVER use ["type_text"] - this is not a typing task
‚Üí Even if the message mentions "code", "tables", "define", "create" - it's still analysis, not typing
‚Üí The user wants YOU to solve/analyze, not type instructions for them

${limitedContext ? `IMPORTANT CONTEXT INFORMATION:
The user has provided context: "${limitedContext.substring(0, 300)}${limitedContext.length > 300 ? '...' : ''}"

USE THIS CONTEXT to understand what the user is referring to when they say "this", "it", or similar references.` : ''}

EXECUTION PATTERNS:
- **SINGLE**: One tool needed
- **PARALLEL**: Multiple independent tasks that can run simultaneously (use when user says "and also")
- **SEQUENTIAL_CHAINED**: Multiple tasks where second task uses output from first task (use when user says "and then")

CRITICAL PATTERN DETECTION:
- If message contains "and then" ‚Üí MUST use "sequential_chained" execution
- If message contains "and also" ‚Üí MUST use "parallel" execution  
- NEVER override these patterns - they indicate user intent for execution order

SMART SEQUENTIAL DETECTION:
Even without explicit "and then", use SEQUENTIAL_CHAINED when:
- Communication mentions "details", "results", "what happened" about other tasks
- Pattern: "do X and message/email/tell someone about it" 
- Pattern: "add/create things and communicate/share/tell about them"
- The communication task needs information from the other tasks to be meaningful

MIXED PATTERN DETECTION:
For messages with BOTH "and also" AND "and then", carefully analyze the structure:
- "A and also B and then C" ‚Üí Tasks: [A, B, C] with sequential_chained execution
- "A and then B and also C" ‚Üí Tasks: [A, B, C] with mixed execution
- Count each distinct action/tool mentioned and include ALL in the tasks array

DYNAMIC ANALYSIS RULES:
1. **CONTEXT ALREADY AVAILABLE**: If context is provided and contains relevant information, DO NOT use content extraction tools (get_clipboard, etc.)
2. **SUMMARIZATION/ANALYSIS TASKS**: If user wants to "summarize", "analyze", "explain", or "process" content AND context is available ‚Üí use ["call_llm"] directly, or ["call_llm", "other_tool"] if chained
3. **SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS**: 
   - "summarize this and email it to X" + context available ‚Üí ["call_llm", "gmail_send_email"] (sequential_chained)
   - "analyze this and then send it to Y" + context available ‚Üí ["call_llm", "send_imessage"] (sequential_chained)
   - "summarize my costs and email to arif" + context available ‚Üí ["call_llm", "gmail_send_email"] (sequential_chained)
4. **CALENDAR PATTERNS**:
   - "Add event A and also add event B" ‚Üí ["calendar_create_event", "calendar_create_event"] (parallel)
   - "Add event A and also add event B and then message John" ‚Üí ["calendar_create_event", "calendar_create_event", "send_imessage"] (sequential_chained)
   - "Add events and message Mario the details" ‚Üí ["calendar_create_event", "send_imessage"] (sequential_chained - message needs event details)
   - Count EACH "add event" or "create event" mention as a separate calendar_create_event task
5. **ANALYSIS/SOLVING PATTERNS**:
   - "solve all questions" ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (analyze and solve, don't type)
   - "solve the problems" ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (analyze and solve, don't type)
   - "answer the questions" ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (analyze and provide answers, don't type)
   - "work through this" ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (analyze and work through, don't type)
   - CRITICAL: Solving/answering tasks should use call_llm for analysis, NOT type_text for typing
6. **COMMUNICATION**: send_imessage, gmail_send_email, start_facetime_call
7. **SYSTEM ACTIONS**: open_app, type_text, click_position, etc.
   - IMPORTANT: type_text is for typing specific text, NOT for solving problems
8. **PURE CONVERSATION**: If just chatting/asking questions without context AND no action requested ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (single)
9. **DATA MANIPULATION**: get_clipboard, set_clipboard, create_note, etc.

CRITICAL RECOGNITION PATTERNS:
- User says "summarize this" + context available ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (skip content extraction tools)
- User says "analyze this" + context available ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (skip content extraction tools)  
- User says "explain this" + context available ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (skip content extraction tools)
- User says "solve all questions" + context available ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (analyze and solve, don't type)
- User says "solve these questions" + context available ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (analyze and solve, don't type)
- User says "solve the problems" + context available ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (analyze and solve, don't type)  
- User says "answer the questions" + context available ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (analyze and answer, don't type)
- User says "help with questions" + context available ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (analyze and help, don't type)
- User says "work through problems" + context available ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (analyze and work through, don't type)
- User says "summarize X and email/message to Y" + context available ‚Üí ["call_llm", "gmail_send_email"/"send_imessage"] (sequential_chained)
- User just wants to chat without specific context AND no action ‚Üí ["call_llm"]
- User wants to perform system actions (NOT solving/analyzing) ‚Üí appropriate system tools

CRITICAL OVERRIDE RULES:
- ANY message containing "solve", "answer", "help with", "work through" + "questions"/"problems" ‚Üí ALWAYS use ["call_llm"] NOT type_text
- Even if message mentions "code", "tables", "snippets" - if it's about solving/answering questions ‚Üí use ["call_llm"] for analysis
- type_text is ONLY for typing specific predetermined text, NOT for solving academic problems

AVOID REDUNDANT CONTENT EXTRACTION:
- If context contains text content, DO NOT use get_clipboard  
- If context has the information needed, go directly to processing tools (call_llm, etc.)
- Content extraction tools are only needed when NO relevant context is available

IMPORTANT: If user requests an action (like "email", "message", "send") even with poor context, still use the appropriate tools. Don't classify as conversation just because context seems insufficient.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- ALWAYS use call_llm when user needs content analysis, summarization, or explanation
- If context is available, trust it and skip redundant content extraction
- Be flexible and dynamic - analyze the actual intent
- For any communication tool (email/message), always set needsTools: true  
- Choose tools based on INTENT and CONTEXT, not just keywords
- Break down complex requests into logical tool sequences

      content: systemPrompt

      role: 'user',
      content: `Message: "${message}"

CRITICAL ANALYSIS NEEDED:
1. If this message contains multiple calendar events, count EACH one as a separate calendar_create_event in tasks
2. If communication mentions "details", "results", or refers to information from other tasks ‚Üí use SEQUENTIAL_CHAINED
3. Pattern "do X and message/email someone about it" ‚Üí SEQUENTIAL_CHAINED (communication needs X results)

Examples:
- "Add event A and also add event B and then message John" ‚Üí sequential_chained, tasks: [calendar_create_event, calendar_create_event, send_imessage]  
- "Add events and message Mario the details" ‚Üí sequential_chained, tasks: [calendar_create_event, send_imessage] (message needs event details)
- "Add events and also send reminder to John" ‚Üí parallel (independent tasks)

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SOLVING EXAMPLES:
- "solve these questions for me" ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (analysis task, NOT typing)
- "help with the following questions: define null hypothesis, create table drought" ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (analysis task, NOT typing)  
- "answer the questions about creating tables and code" ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (analysis task, NOT typing)
- "work through these problems step by step" ‚Üí ["call_llm"] (analysis task, NOT typing)
